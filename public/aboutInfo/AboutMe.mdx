# Hi, I'm Aleia!
<br/>
I like learning new things, especially when they relate to projects I'm interested in. I enjoy working on programming, electronics, and 3D-Modeling (primarily with Rhino7 and Fusion360).

In my free time I enjoy working on personal projects, drawing, and gaming. My favorite games to play are Warframe, No Man's Sky, and FFXIV.
