## aConfusedWebsite

Maintained personally by me, aConfusedAmpwave. Once the site is like fully setup it'll have updates anytime I have a new project to share or changes to my resume and such.

## How its made

The domain was purchased from Cloudfare and the website is deployed using Vercel. I used nextjs and tailwind, which I haven't worked with either beforehand. Thought this would be a good chance to refresh my knowledge on webdesign.
